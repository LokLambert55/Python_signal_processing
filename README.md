# Python Signal Processing – Engineering Portfolio Project

This project demonstrates essential signal processing techniques frequently used in **MEMS**, **sensor systems**, and **embedded engineering**.

It includes:
- Synthetic sensor signal creation  
- Noise modeling  
- Moving average filtering  
- Butterworth low-pass filtering  
- FFT-based frequency analysis  
- Clean Jupyter Notebook with explanations
